<h1>A Ball of Snow, a haiku by Matsuo Basho</h1>
<p>My friend Sora had moved in nearby, and we visit each other anytime, night or day.</p>

<p>While I am preparing a meal, he breaks up branches for the fire; when I boil tea, he breaks up ice for the water.</p>

<p>He likes the solitary life and our friendship is as strong as iron.</p>
</br>

<p>One night after a snowfall he came visiting:</p>

<p>you make the fire</p>
<p>and Iâ€™ll show you something wonderful:</p>
<p>a big ball of snow!</p>
